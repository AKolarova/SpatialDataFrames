    "## Creating Spatial Dataframes (1)\n",
    "ENV 859 - Fall 2022  \n",

    "### What is a spatial dataframe\n",
    "A **spatial dataframe** (aka a **geodataframe**) is much like a typical Pandas dataframe except that it accomodates a new datatype: the **geometry** data type. The geometry, as you might guess can contain geometric features: points, lines, and polygons, each of which is defined by a single or series of coordinate pairs. These spatial dataframes are also assigned a **coordinate reference system (crs)**, which links these coordinates to specific places on the Earth and allows us to do geospatial analysis. In other words, these spatial dataframes are quite the same as our familiar GIS feature classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries for working with spatial dataframes\n",
    "To work with spatial dataframes, we need one of two Python libraries, each of which has its own version of the spatial dataframe and its own set of functions and classes. First is **geopandas**, which has been around for a while, and then there's the newcomer, the **ArcGIS API for Python** (which really needs a better name). There's much overlap among the two, but also some very important distinctions and its useful to know the basics of both. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The lessons\n",
    "Here in this first lesson, we review several techniques for creating spatial dataframes from various source formats using both GeoPandas and the ArcGIS API for Python. The source formats include:\n",
    "1. A delimited text file (e.g. CSV) containing coordinate columns and a know coordinate reference system\n",
    "2. An existing feature class in the form of a shapefile or within a geodatabase\n",
    "3. Other formats: GeoJSON files, KML, and ArcGIS REST-based web services"

    "### Using GeoPandas\n",
    "The process of importing a CSV file into a GeoPandas geodataframe consists of first importing the data into a Pandas dataframe and then creating a **GeoSeries** - or column of geometry objects - from the coordinate columns. Then we construct the geodataframe using the GeoPandas `GeoDataFrame()` function supplying the original dataframe, the geoseries object, and the coordinate reference system or `crs`. "
