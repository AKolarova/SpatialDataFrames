    "## Creating Spatial Dataframes (1)\n",

    "### What is a spatial dataframe\n",
    "A **spatial dataframe** (aka a **geodataframe**) is much like a typical Pandas dataframe except that it accomodates a new datatype: the **geometry** data type. The geometry, as you might guess can contain geometric features: points, lines, and polygons, each of which is defined by a single or series of coordinate pairs. These spatial dataframes are also assigned a **coordinate reference system (crs)**, which links these coordinates to specific places on the Earth and allows us to do geospatial analysis. In other words, these spatial dataframes are quite the same as our familiar GIS feature classes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries for working with spatial dataframes\n",
    "To work with spatial dataframes, we need one of two Python libraries, each of which has its own version of the spatial dataframe and its own set of functions and classes. First is **geopandas**, which has been around for a while, and then there's the newcomer, the **ArcGIS API for Python** (which really needs a better name). In this notebook we explore the former, **geopandas**, focusing in on how we create the GeoDataframes from existing data in various formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "The source formats we examine include:\n",
    "1. A delimited text file (e.g. CSV) containing coordinate columns and a know coordinate reference system\n",
    "2. An existing feature class in the form of a shapefile or within a geodatabase\n",
    "3. Other formats: GeoJSON files, KML, and [kind of] GeoDatabases."

    "## Lesson 1. Creating spatial dataframes from CSV files using GeoPandas\n",
    "In this example, we examine how to create a point spatial dataframe from a CSV file containing latitude and longitude coordinates. The data we'll use in this exercise is electric vehicle charging locations in North Carolina ([source](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of importing a CSV file into a GeoPandas geodataframe consists of first importing the data into a Pandas dataframe and then creating a **GeoSeries** - or column of geometry objects - from the coordinate columns. Then we construct the geodataframe using the GeoPandas `GeoDataFrame()` function supplying the original dataframe, the geoseries object, and the coordinate reference system or `crs`. "
